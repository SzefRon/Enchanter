## What is this?

This is an experimental **VST** plugin made with **JUCE** and **JuMake**.

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SzefRon/Enchanter/refs/heads/master/img/interface.png)

## What does it do?

It encrypts and decrypt incoming audio signal in real time. This encryption contains spectral information derived from the signal.

## What's the point?

You, the user, can put any effect plugin on the encrypted part of the signal to achieve some gnarly effects!

## Is it useful?

Well... that's the *experimental* part of this plugin. Anything you put between the encryption and decryption part is basically undefined behavior. My goal with this plugin is to find which other plugins can achieve the most interesting results and perhaps find out if there's any possible predictable behavior.

## Why did you make it?

The idea of creating this plugin was part of my Engineer's thesis! I decided to expand on it afterwards as I wasn't limited by time anymore.

## How do I use it?
